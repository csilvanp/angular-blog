This project is being builded with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2. It's mainly inspirated in the "Creating a blog with Angular" project in Angular Bootcamp by [DIO](https://www.dio.me), with some minor changes. My first time trying Angular, totally open to suggestions, so feel free to make a PR if you want!
